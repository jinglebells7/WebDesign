<p>With fewer than 4,000 of these iconic animals in the wild today, tiger
populations have been in a rapid decline over the past century. These already
endangered big cats are being driven towards extinction, as demand for tiger
products continue. Learn how traditional Chinese medicine, tiger bone wine, and
even selfies are complicit in this destruction. For more on tiger conservation and

<h2 class="bluetext">Siberian Tigers</h2>

<p>Siberian tiger, (subspecies Panthera tigris altaica), subspecies of tiger (Pantheria tigris) inhabiting the cold-climate forests of the Primorye and Khabarovsk territories of far-eastern Russia as well as northeastern China. In appearance, the Siberian tiger is distinguished from other tiger subspecies (such as the similar-looking but hot-climate Bengal tiger) by its muted orange coat accented by black stripes, its thick fur, and its size; it is considered by many experts to be the worldâ€™s largest tiger (the Bengal tiger ranking second largest). Fewer than 600 Siberian tigers remain in the wild, while several hundred more are kept in zoos and nature parks worldwide.(https://www.britannica.com/animal/Siberian-tiger)</p>
