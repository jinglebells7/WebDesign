Michael Jordan started his career in North Carolina. When he played high school basketball he was cut from the varsity team as a sophomore. This motivated him intensely! After that, he worked on his game endlessly. This drive is what led him to play for North Carolina.</p>
<p>After playing at <b>North Carolina</b>, Michael Jordan was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 1985 draft with the 3rd overall pick. This again upset Michael. He wanted to be the number 1 overall pick. With this motivation Michael Jordan went on to win 6 NBA championships (both in the form of 3-peats). Below is a picture of the 6 championship trophies.</p>
